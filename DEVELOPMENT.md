# Development Log

## GrowthBook Integration

### Initial Setup
1. Created basic Flask application structure
2. Set up GrowthBook SDK integration
3. Implemented feature flag handling for UI variations

### Integration Steps
1. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set up `.env` file with GrowthBook configuration
   - Configured API host and client key

2. **GrowthBook Client Implementation**
   - Created `growthbook_client.py` for SDK integration
   - Implemented feature flag evaluation
   - Added error handling and fallback values
   - Fixed attribute access in GrowthBook client
   - Improved logging for feature flag variations

3. **Flask Application Updates**
   - Added request-scoped GrowthBook instances
   - Implemented feature flag variations in routes
   - Added proper cleanup after requests
   - Implemented random user ID generation for home page
   - Maintained consistent user ID for item pages using cookies

### User ID Management
- Home page: Generates new random user ID on each refresh for easy testing
- Item pages: Maintains consistent user ID using cookies
- Each user ID is used for GrowthBook feature flag evaluation
- Improved logging of user IDs and their variations

### Feature Flags
Currently implemented feature flags:
- `ui_color`: Controls the UI color theme (default: 'light')
- `item_link_behavior`: Controls link behavior (default: 'same_tab')
